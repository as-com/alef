This package only includes Inferno bindings for [Alef](http://github.com/as-com/alef).<br>
It assumes you already know about Alef and how to use it.

## Installation
```sh
yarn add inferno-alef
```
You may alternatively use `npm i --save inferno-alef`.


## API
This package does not ship separate API documentation as it implements the exact same API as the [react-alef](https://github.com/as-com/alef/packages/react-alef) bindings. Check those out instead.

## Usage
For more information and best practices on how to effectively use this package, please check out the main [Alef Documention - Usage with Inferno](http://alef.js.org/docs/guides/UsageWithInferno.html). There you will also find some usage examples. This package only contains the pure API reference documentation.
